  <title>118. Zaccheus (Camp Book)</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Chorus: [: There was a man in Jericho
 called Zaccheus (Zac-che-us) :]
 Not the Hebrews, they were tall (very tall),
 but Zaccheus, he was small (teeny-weeny),
 Yet the Lord loved Zacheus, better than them all.

[V1]
 1. The Lord went walking one day through Jericho town,
 and the people began to gather from miles around.
 But Zaccheus, he couldn't see,
 so he climbed a Sycamore tree,
 and the Lord look up and saoid,
 "Zaccheus, come down."

[V2]
 2. The Lord said, "Zaccheus, I am dining with you today.
 Zaccheus, I come to your house, come lead the way."
 Then Zaccheus, he gave a cheer,
 but the people began to sneer,
 "This man is a sinner,
 does teh Lord seek lodging here?"

[V3]
 3. Now Zaccheus was amall of stature, but he could show,
 that a man who is stout of heart cam grow and grow.
 "if I have cheated young and old,
 I restore the goods four fold."
 And salvation cam that day
 to his whole household.</lyrics>

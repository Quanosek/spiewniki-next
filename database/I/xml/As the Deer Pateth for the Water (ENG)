  <title>As the Deer Pateth for the Water</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 1. As the deer, panteth for the water,
 so my soul longeth after Thee.
 You alone are my heart's desire
 and I long to worship Thee.

[C]
 Chorus: You alone are my Strength, my Shield,
 to You alone may my spirit yield.
 You alone are my heart's desire
 and I long to worship Thee.

[V2]
 2. You're my Friend and You are my Brother
 Even though You are a King
 I love You more than any other
 So much more than anything.

[V3]
 3. I want You more than gold or silver
 Only You can satisfy
 You alone are the real joy-giver
 And the apple of my eye.</lyrics>

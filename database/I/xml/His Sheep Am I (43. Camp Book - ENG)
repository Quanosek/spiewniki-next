  <title>43. His Sheep Am I (Camp Book)</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 1. In God's green pastures feeding,
 by His cool waters lie.
 Soft in the evening walk my Lord and I.
 All the sheep of His pasture
 so wonderously fine.
 His sheep am I.

[C]
 Chorus: Waters cool (in the valley),
 pastures green (on the mountain),
 In the evening walk my Lord and I.
 Dark the night (in the valley),
 rought the way (on the mountain),
 step by step my Lord and I.

[V2]
 2. Yes, the Lord is my Shepherd
 and no want shall I know;
 He'll guide and comfort me
 where'ere I go.
 On the mountain, in the valley,
 by His hand, he will lead.
 His sheep am I.

[V3]
 3. Throught I walk in death's shadowed
 vale no ill shall I fear,
 Calmly I feel His loving presence near.
 For his rod and his staff
 will gently show me the way.
 His sheep am I.</lyrics>

  <title>2. Amazing Grace (Camp Book)</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 1. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,
 that saved a wretch like me!
 I once was lost, but now am found.
 Was blind, but now I see.

[V2]
 2. 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
 and grace my fears relieved.
 How precious did that grace appear
 the hour I first believed!

[V3]
 3. Throught many dangers, toils and sneares,
 I have already come;
 'tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
 and grace will lead me home.

[V4]
 4. The Lord has promised good to me,
 His word my hope secures;
 he will my shield and portion be
 as long as life endures.

[V5]
 5. When we've been there ten thousand years,
 bright shining as the sun,
 we've no less days to sing God's praise
 than when we've first begun.</lyrics>
